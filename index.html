                    write efficient and optimized code under time constraints. I have a strong foundation in data structures and algorithms, 
                    as well as experience working with programming languages C and C++. I am familiar with various 
                    online judges, such as Codeforces, CodeChef and HackerRank, and have contributed to open-source projects on platforms like GitHub.
